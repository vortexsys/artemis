# Artemis
 Similar to my multi-tools project, but just better

 This project supports community add-ons (extensions) because of the extensions folder, take a look at example.py in the extensions folder on how a file would need to look atleast.
 
 After making a python file for this program, you need to put it into the extensions folder.

## What exactly is this Artemis?
Basically this is a software able to run python files that are thrown together into the extensions folder with (mostly) no problems.

It is similar to my project [multi-tools](https://github.com/vortexsys/multi-tools) but (imo) better as it is designed to support community scripts and updates.

This is only the standalone version tho, official python files will be [here](https://github.com/v0rtexdev/artemis)
