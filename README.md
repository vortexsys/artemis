# Artemis
 Similar to my multi-tools project, but just better

 This project supports community add-ons (extensions) because of the extensions folder, take a look at example.py in the extensions folder on how a file would need to look atleast.
 
 After making a python file for this program, you need to put it into the extensions folder.
